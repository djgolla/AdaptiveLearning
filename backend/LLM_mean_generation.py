# 1. Get question from LLM. Response should include question text, topic, variables, operations.
# 2. Solve question using Python (potentially Wolfram Alpha API) to obtain correct answer.
# 3. Generate 4 unique answer options, including correct answer, using LLM.
# 4. Send question and answer options to frontend to display to user.

mean_prompt = f"""
You are to provide a Math question suitable for 6th–8th grade students. The response must be in JSON format. 
The Question Text, Question Topic, and Variables will be displayed. The Question Topic will be "mean".

Mean example: "What is the mean of these values: 12, 15, 18, 21, 24" 
The question should include the listof values to be used when finding the solution. Each numeric value should be listed in the variables array.

Use a variety of integer values as long as the mean has a WHOLE number solution. To ensure this, the sum of the values should be divisible by the number of values.

Return ONLY valid JSON with no text before or after the JSON object.

The JSON must follow this exact structure:

{{
  "question_text": "What is the mean of these values: 12, 15, 18, 21, 24",
  "question_topic": "mean",
  "variables": ["12","15","18","21","24"]
}}

Rules:
- Use ONLY double quotes for all strings.
- The JSON object must contain the keys "question_text", "question_topic", and "variables".
- "variables" must be a list of strings.
- No rationals or decimals allowed
- Do NOT include any text or characters outside the JSON object.
