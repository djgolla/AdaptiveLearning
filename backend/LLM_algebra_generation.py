# 1. Get question from LLM. Response should include question text, topic, variables, operations.
# 2. Solve question using Python (potentially Wolfram Alpha API) to obtain correct answer.
# 3. Generate 4 unique answer options, including correct answer, using LLM.
# 4. Send question and answer options to frontend to display to user.

#Potential topic types. 

#Topics: 
#Ordering (e.g order numbers (including negatives and two digit decimal values) from least to greatest or vice versa). For least to greatest the question topic should be 'ordering-least', otherwise it is 'ordering-greatest'. 
#Rationals: (operations involving two fractions. Varaibles should be in the format '2/5' for a single fraction). The expected operation type should also be included.
#Operations: Variables should be in the format '2/5' for a single fraction, or 'x' for a variable. Additionally, the operations should be clearly defined from left to right using '+', '-', '*', '/' to indicate the operations. Both variables and operations will be realized left to right. For example, a question with variables '2', '3', '4', '+', '*' will be seen as 2 + 3 * 4, and the operations will be performed left to right, so it will be (2 + 3) * 4 = 20.
#Expressions: ex 'Simplify the expression 4(2x - 3).' The question should include the expression to be simplified, and the expected operation type should also be included. Variables should be in the format 'x' for a variable, and operations should be defined using '+', '-', '*', '/' to indicate the operations. The operations will be performed left to right, so for example, a question with variables '2x', '-3', '4', '*', will be seen as 2x - 3 * 4, and the operations will be performed left to right, so it will be (2x - 3) * 4 = 8x - 12.
#Algebra: ex 'Solve for x: 2x + 3 = 7.' The question should include the equation to be solved, and the expected operation type should also be included. Variables should be in the format 'x' for a variable, and operations should be defined using '+', '-', '*', '/' to indicate the operations. The operations will be performed left to right, so for example, a question with variables '2x', '+', '3', '=', '7', will be seen as 2x + 3 = 7, and the operations will be performed left to right, so it will be 2x = 4, and x = 2.
#Geometry: ex 'Find the area of a circle with a radius of 6 cm.' The question should include the geometric figure to be analyzed, and the expected operation type should also be included. Variables should be in the format '6 cm' for a variable, and operations should be defined using '+', '-', '*', '/' to indicate the operations. For example, a question with variables 'radius', '6 cm', 'area', '*', 'pi', will be seen as area = radius * radius * pi, and the operations will be performed left to right, so it will be area = 6 cm * 6 cm * pi = 36pi cm^2. Area, Perimeter, and Volume for simple shapes are potential questions. 
#Angle relationships: 'IF two angles are complementary and one angle measures 35 degrees, what is the measure of the other angle?' The question should include the angle relationship to be analyzed, and the expected operation type should also be included. Variables should be in the format '35 degrees' for a variable, and operations should be defined using '+', '-', '*', '/' to indicate the operations. For example, a question with variables 'angle1', '35 degrees', 'angle2', '+', 'complementary', will be seen as angle1 + angle2 = 90 degrees, and the operations will be performed left to right, so it will be 35 degrees + angle2 = 90 degrees, and angle2 = 55 degrees.
#Mean: Provide a short to medium sized integer or decimal variable dataset. 
#Median: Provide a short to medium sized integer or decimal variable dataset.
#Mode: Provide a short to medium sized integer or decimal variable dataset.
#Probability: ex 'A bag contains 5 red marbles, 3 blue marbles, and 2 green marbles. If a marble is drawn at random, what is the probability of drawing a red marble?' The question should include the probability scenario to be analyzed, and the expected operation type should also be included. Variables should be in the format '5 red marbles' for a variable, and operations should be defined using '+', '-', '*', '/' to indicate the operations. For example, a question with variables 'red marbles', '5', 'blue marbles', '3', 'green marbles', '2', 'total marbles', '+', 'probability of red marble', '/', 'total marbles', will be seen as probability of red marble = red marbles / total marbles, and the operations will be performed left to right, so it will be probability of red marble = 5 / (5 + 3 + 2) = 5/10 = 1/2.

algebra_prompt = f"""
You are to provide a Math question suitable for students. The response must be in JSON format. 
The Question Text, Question Topic, and Variables will be displayed. The Question Topic will be "algebra".

Algebra example: "Solve for x: 2x + 3 = 7." 
The question should include the equation to be solved. Variables must be formatted as strings such as "x", and operations must be 
represented using the symbols "+", "-", "*", "/". For example, the variables list ["2x", "+", "3", "=", "7"] represents the equation 2x + 3 = 7.

There may be up to three operations on the left-hand side, and up to two terms may contain the variable "x". 
Use a variety of integer values as long as the equation has a valid solution.

Return ONLY valid JSON with no text before or after the JSON object.

The JSON must follow this exact structure:

{{  "question_text": "Solve for x: 2x + 3 = 7.",
  "question_topic": "algebra",
  "variables": ["2x", "+", "3", "=", "7"]
}}

Rules:
- Use ONLY double quotes for all strings.
- The JSON object must contain the keys "question_text", "question_topic", and "variables".
- "variables" must be a list of strings.
- Do NOT include any characters outside the JSON object.
