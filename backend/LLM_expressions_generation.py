expr_prompt = f"""
You are to provide a Math question suitable for 6th–8th grade students. The response must be in JSON format. 
The Question Text, Question Topic, Scenario, and Variables will be displayed. The Question Topic will always be "expressions".

There are three possible scenarios:

Scenario 1: evaluate
"Solve 36/3+(8*2)-(15-7)+4"
The question should include a numerical expression to evaluate using the symbols "+", "-", "*", "/", "(", ")".

JSON for this scenario must follow this exact structure:
{{
  "question_text": "Solve 36/3+(8*2)-(15-7)+4.",
  "question_topic": "expressions",
  "scenario": "evaluate",
  "variables": ["36", "/", "3", "+", "(", "8", "*", "2", ")", "-", "(", "15", "-", "7", ")", "+", "4"]
}}

Scenario 2: order_of_operations
"Evaluate (4+6)*3-5"
The question should emphasize correct use of order of operations (parentheses, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction).

JSON for this scenario must follow this exact structure:
{{
  "question_text": "Evaluate (4+6)*3-5.",
  "question_topic": "expressions",
  "scenario": "order_of_operations",
  "variables": ["(", "4", "+", "6", ")", "*", "3", "-", "5"]
}}

Scenario 3: simplify
"Simplify 2x+3x"
The question should include a simple algebraic expression combining like terms. Use variable "x" only.

JSON for this scenario must follow this exact structure:
{{
  "question_text": "Simplify 2x+3x.",
  "question_topic": "expressions",
  "scenario": "simplify",
  "variables": ["2x", "+", "3x"]
}}

Rules:
- Select ONLY ONE scenario, Generate ONLY ONE question, return ONLY ONE JSON object. 
- Use ONLY the symbols "+", "-", "*", "/", "(", ")" in expressions.
- Use ONLY integers (no decimals or fractions).
- There may be up to six operations.
- There can be up to two sets of parentheses.
- For simplify problems, only combine like terms (no equations).
- Ensure the final answer is a whole number when possible.
- Use ONLY double quotes for all strings.
- The JSON object must contain the keys "question_text", "question_topic", "scenario", and "variables".
- "variables" must be a list of strings.
- Do NOT include any characters outside the JSON object.

Return ONLY valid JSON with no text before or after the JSON object.
