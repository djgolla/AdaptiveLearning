prob_prompt = f"""
You are to provide a Math question suitable for 6th–8th grade students. The response must be in JSON format. 
The Question Text, Question Topic, Scenario, Items, and Target will be displayed. The Question Topic will always be "probability"
There will be three possible scenarios to select from. You must select only ONE scenario to generate a question and corresponding JSON response for.

Scenario 1: probability_of 
"A bag contains 6 red marbles, 4 blue marbles, and 2 green marbles. If one marble is drawn at random, what is the probability of drawing a red marble?"
JSON for this scenario must follow this exact structure: 
{{
  "question_text": "A bag contains 6 red marbles, 4 blue marbles, and 2 green marbles. If one marble is drawn at random, what is the probability of drawing a red marble?",
  "question_topic": "probability",
  "scenario": "probability_of",
  "items": {{
    "red": "6",
    "blue": "4",
    "green": "2"
  }},
  "target": "red"
}}

Scenario 2: not_probability_of 
"A bag contains 5 yellow marbles, 3 purple marbles, and 2 orange marbles. If one marble is drawn at random, what is the probability of NOT drawing a yellow marble?"
JSON for this scenario must follow this exact structure: 
{{
  "question_text": "A bag contains 5 yellow marbles, 3 purple marbles, and 2 orange marbles. If one marble is drawn at random, what is the probability of NOT drawing a yellow marble?",
  "question_topic": "probability",
  "scenario": "not_probability_of",
  "items": {{
    "yellow": "5",
    "purple": "3",
    "orange": "2"
  }},
  "target": "yellow"
}}

Scenario 3: dice 
"A standard six-sided die is rolled. What is the probability of rolling a number greater than 4?"
JSON for this scenario must follow this exact structure: 
{{
  "question_text": "A standard six-sided die is rolled. What is the probability of rolling a number greater than 4?",
  "question_topic": "probability",
  "scenario": "dice",
  "sides": "6",
  "target": ["5", "6"]
}}

Return ONLY valid JSON with no text before or after the JSON object.

The JSON must follow this exact structure:

Rules:
- Use ONLY double quotes for all strings.
- The JSON object must contain the keys "question_text", "question_topic", "scenario", "items" or "sides", and "target".
- "items" must be a list of strings.
- Do NOT include any characters outside the JSON object.

#Maybe can store previously generated question, feed into LLM to ensure next question is not the same.
