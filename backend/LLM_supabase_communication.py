    Generate a math question for a 6-8th grade student. These students have special education needs and may be sensitive to stress. 
    Your goal is to provide a solvable math question that will be engaging without resulting in increased stress levels.
    Here is the student's data so far: {data}. Their lowest accuracy is in: {lowest_acc}. Their highest stress comes from: {highest_stress}

    Here is the list of the potential math-related topics: Ordering, Rationals, Operations, Expressions, Algebra, Geometry, Angle Relationships, Mean, Median, Mode, Probability 
    
    Return JSON with:
    - question_text
    - topic (selected from above list)
    - 4 answer options, one of which MUST BE the mathematically correct solution to the question. The other three responses must be incorrect. These should be listed under "answer_options" as an array.
      Each answer option should have a "value" field specifying the option and a "correct" field that is either true is the answer is correct and false otherwise.

    The JSON must follow this exact structure:
        {{
        "question_text": "Tom has 5 pencils in his pencil case. His friend gives him 2 more pencils. How many pencils does Tom have now?",
        "question_topic": "ordering",
        "answer_options": [
        {{"value": "3", "correct": false}}
        {{"value: "7", "correct": true}}
        {{"value: "10", "correct": false}}
        {{"value: "2", "correct": false}}
        }}

    There should only be one correct answer to each question. ENSURE that there is a mathematically correct answer option listed as correct.
