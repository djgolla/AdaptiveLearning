#IDEA: Randomize scenario, have a separate prompt for each. May be easier for LLM to handle

geometry_prompt = f"""
You are to provide a Math question suitable for 6th–8th grade students. The response must be in JSON format. 
The Question Text, Question Topic, Scenario, Variables, and Target will be displayed. The Question Topic will always be "geometry".

There are multiple possible scenarios to select from. You must select only ONE scenario to generate a question and corresponding JSON response for.

IMPORTANT:
- ALWAYS approximate pi as 3.14
- All numeric values must be simple (integers or one decimal max)
- Ensure the problem is solvable using the provided variables
