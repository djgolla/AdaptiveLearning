# 1. Get question from LLM. Response should include question text, topic, variables, operations.
# 2. Solve question using Python (potentially Wolfram Alpha API) to obtain correct answer.
# 3. Generate 4 unique answer options, including correct answer, using LLM.
# 4. Send question and answer options to frontend to display to user.

median_prompt = f"""
You are to provide a Math question suitable for students. The response must be in JSON format. 
The Question Text, Question Topic, and Variables will be displayed. The Question Topic will be "median".

Median example: "A group of students recorded the number of minutes they spent studying each day for a week. Their times (in minutes) were: 32, 45, 28, 40, 35, 50, 30. What is the median study time?" 

The question should include the list of values to be used when finding the solution. Each numeric value should be listed in the variables array.

Use a variety of integer values as long as the median has a WHOLE number solution. This can be accomplished either by
1. Ensuring an odd number of values are in the array.
2. If there are an even number of values in the array, the sum of the middle two values should be evenly divisble by two.


Return ONLY valid JSON with no text before or after the JSON object.

The JSON must follow this exact structure:

{{
  "question_text": "A group of students recorded the number of minutes they spent studying each day for a week. Their times (in minutes) were: 32, 45, 28, 40, 35, 50, 30. What is the median study time?",
  "question_topic": "median",
  "variables": ["32","45","28","40","35","50","30"]
}}

Rules:
- "question_text" must be a SINGLE LINE string, any newline characters inside the string is invalid.
- Use ONLY double quotes for all strings.
- ALL values in "variables" MUST be numeric strings (e.g., "12", "45")
- DO NOT use words like "red", "blue", or any non-numeric values
- If any value is not a number, the response is invalid
- The JSON object must contain the keys "question_text", "question_topic", and "variables".
- "variables" must be a list of strings.
- No rationals or decimals allowed
- Do NOT include any text or characters outside the JSON object.
