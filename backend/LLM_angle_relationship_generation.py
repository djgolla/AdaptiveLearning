You are to provide a Math question suitable for 6th–8th grade students. The response must be in JSON format. 
The Question Text, Question Topic, Scenario, and Variables will be displayed. The Question Topic will always be "angle_relationships".
There will be four possible scenarios to select from. You must select only ONE scenario to generate a question and corresponding JSON response for.

Scenario 1: complementary
"Two angles are complementary. One angle is 35°. What is the other angle?"
JSON for this scenario must follow this exact structure:
{{
  "question_text": "Two angles are complementary. One angle is 35°. What is the other angle?",
  "question_topic": "angle_relationships",
  "scenario": "complementary",
  "variables": ["35"]
}}

Scenario 2: supplementary
"Two angles are supplementary. One angle is 135°. What is the other angle?"
JSON for this scenario must follow this exact structure:
{{
  "question_text": "Two angles are supplementary. One angle is 135°. What is the other angle?",
  "question_topic": "angle_relationships",
  "scenario": "supplementary",
  "variables": ["135"]
}}

Scenario 3: linear_pair
"Two angles form a straight line. One angle is 140°. What is the other angle?"
JSON for this scenario must follow this exact structure:
{{
  "question_text": "Two angles form a straight line. One angle is 140°. What is the other angle?",
  "question_topic": "angle_relationships",
  "scenario": "linear_pair",
  "variables": ["140"]
}}

Scenario 4: triangle_sum
"A triangle has angles 50° and 60°. What is the third angle?"
JSON for this scenario must follow this exact structure:
{{
  "question_text": "A triangle has angles 50° and 60°. What is the third angle?",
  "question_topic": "angle_relationships",
  "scenario": "triangle_sum",
  "variables": ["50", "60"]
}}

Scenario 5: algebra_complementary
"Two angles are complementary: (x + 10)° and (2x − 20)°. Find x."
JSON for this scenario must follow this exact structure:
{{
  "question_text": "Two angles are complementary: (x + 10)° and (2x − 20)°. Find x.",
  "question_topic": "angle_relationships",
  "scenario": "algebra_complementary",
  "variables": ["x + 10", "2x - 20"]
}}

Return ONLY valid JSON with no text before or after the JSON object.

The JSON must follow this exact structure:

Rules:
- Select ONLY ONE scenario, Generate ONLY ONE question, return ONLY ONE JSON object. 
- Use ONLY double quotes for all strings.
- The JSON object must contain the keys "question_text", "question_topic", "scenario", and "variables".
- "variables" must be a list of strings.
- Do NOT include any text or characters outside the JSON object.
