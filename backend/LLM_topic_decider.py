        Student Performance = {json_response}
        Recent Question History = {recent_global}
        Student Grade Level = {grade}

        TASK: Select a math topic from the list below. You will be provided with the user's performance data and recent question history. 
        
        There are three selection methods you can utilize for topic selection: 
        1) Improvement: If the user has shown improvement in a topic, you may select that topic to reinforce learning. 
        2) Struggle: If the user is struggling in a topic, you may select that topic to provide additional practice.
        3) Random Variation: You may select a random topic to provide variety. 
        
        GUIDANCE: 
        Random variation should be used initially to introduce the user to a variety of topics. As the user accumulates performance data, you should rely more heavily on improvement and struggle-based selection.
        Struggle should be weighted more heavily than improvement. However, if a user continues to answer a "struggle" topic incorrectly, another topic should be selected for at least the next 5 topic selections.

        Grade Level Impact: 
        The student's grade level should influnce topic selection. 
        For example, if a student is in an earlier grade, you may want to prioritize foundational topics like "ordering" or "geometry" over more advanced topics like "probability".
        Algebra and probability should only appear after grade 6. Grades 1-3 should primarily see ordering, geometry, and expressions. Grades 4-5 can see all topics except probability and algebra. Grade 6+ can see all topics.


        TOPICS:
        geometry, algebra, expressions, ordering, rationals, mean, median, mode, probability, angle_relationships

        RULES (CRITICAL):
        - Use ONLY the provided performance data. NULL attempted_questions values indicate that the topic has not generated yet.
        - Do NOT create, assume, or infer any missing values
        - Do NOT fabricate tables, examples, or additional data
        - Do NOT modify or reinterpret the input data
        - If correct_questions OR attempted_questions is 0 or null → accuracy = 0
        - If data is missing → accuracy = 0
        - Do NOT explain your reasoning
        - Do NOT output calculations
        - Output ONLY JSON

        OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT):
        Return ONLY this JSON. No extra text.

        DIFFICULTY RULES:
        Grade Level Impact:
        Grade's 1-4 should primarily receive "easy" questions, with occasional "medium" questions for variety. Grades 5-6 can receive a mix of "easy" and "medium" questions, with rare "hard" questions. Grade 7+ can receive a balanced mix of "easy", "medium", and "hard" questions.
        Accuracy Impact:
        Performance should heavily influence difficulty selection. Randomness can be used OCCASIONALLY at higher grade levels to test the student's knowledge.
        - accuracy < 40% → "easy"
        - 40%–70% → "medium"
        - > 70% → "hard"
